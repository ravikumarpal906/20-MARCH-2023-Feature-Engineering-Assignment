This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to make the data more readable, to reduce its size, or to make it compatible with a particular software application.\n","\n","Data encoding is useful in data science for a number of reasons. First, it can help to make the data more readable and understandable. For example, if you have a dataset that contains a lot of categorical data, you can encode the data using one-hot encoding to create a new dataset where each category is represented by a separate binary feature. This can make it easier to visualize the data and to build machine learning models that can use the data.\n","\n","Second, data encoding can help to reduce the size of the data. This can be important if you are working with a large dataset that is taking up a lot of storage space. For example, you can use lossless compression to reduce the size of the data without losing any information.\n","\n","Third, data encoding can help to make the data compatible with a particular software application. For example, if you are using a machine learning library that requires the data to be in a specific format, you can use data encoding to convert the data to that format.\n","\n","Overall, data encoding is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the quality, readability, and usability of data in data science.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uO9RnpuY3SlM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.

In nominal encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer value.

Nominal encoding, on the other hand, only creates one feature for each category.\n","* **When the categories are not ordered.** One-hot encoding assumes that the categories are ordered, which is not always the case.
